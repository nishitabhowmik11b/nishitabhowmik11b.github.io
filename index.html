    Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which began to spread in Wuhan district

      <para3>
        Coronaviruses are a group of RNA viruses that cause illness in birds and mammals. 
        In human beings, many diseases are caused by their strains, from mild ones like common 
        cold (also caused by various other viruses) to more severe ones like SARS, MERS and COVID-19. 
        They are spherical particles with projections. It derives its name from the Latin word "corona" 
        which means crown, which is also the name of the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere.

      <para3>
        Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965. Seven coronaviruses can infect humans. 
        The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries. 
        More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died. MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. 
        It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure. Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.

      <para3>
        Unfortunately, there is no definite cure or vaccine for it yet, but research is ongoing. 
        Viral diseases are almost never treated by drugs that kill the virus, but drugs that help 
        relieve the symptoms and support overall health, while the body's immune system fights the 
        virus itself. This is because viruses enter our own cells and use them to multiply and 
        spread. Any efforts to kill the virus would also negatively effect our cells and cause harm.

        The virus can survive on surfaces for multiple hours, so it is important to keep all surfaces clean 
        and wash our hands regularly. Hands must be washed for at least 20 seconds and sanitizer used should 
        have at least 60% alcohol. Soap and alcohol-based sanitizers kill the virus by destroying its lipid envelope.

    <title3>Wear a Mask</title3>
    <div style="padding-top:20px; padding-right: 50px">
      <para3>
        The virus is spread through droplet infection, meaning that the virus travels through droplets of saliva and 
        mucus that are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks. Wearing a mask has been proven to 
        nearly eliminate this spread entirely. While a mask is worn for the purpose of protecting others from yourself, 
        it can also help you not touch your face, reducing the risk for you too.

      <para3>
        The expulsion of droplets through coughing and sneezing allows them to travel further than you might think, and 
        even stay suspended in air for a period of time. To stay safe, everyone must maintain a minimum distance of 6 feet 
        from each other. It is strongly suggested that you stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary to go outside, 
        since that limits your exposure to potentially infected people.

        It is critical to assert the importance of mental health and stability in this time of chaos. 
        With the shift in lifestyle came an abrupt decline in social interaction, an essential part of 
        human nature, which impacted most of us negatively. It is crucial that we are able to preserve 
        our psychological balance by engaging with family and friends while being miles away from them. 
        Depression and anxiety rates have risen, and if you are suffering from either of those, seek 
        help from people you trust or a professional. Mental health is just as important as physical health.

        While the modern lifestyle is already quite sedentary, lockdown has caused us all to become more even 
        more so. Moreover, with days and nights blending into each other to form a slurry of broken sleep cycles, 
        people's health is at the risk of serious deterioration. One must not let themself go down a spiral of 
        bad health, and to do that, a combination of good diet, exercise and daily routine is necessary. Eat nutritious 
        food to keep your immunity up, sleep at least 7-9 hours a day and on time, and form a habit of exercising 
        daily. Staying healthy will keep you safer during this pandemic, as well as improve your mood.
